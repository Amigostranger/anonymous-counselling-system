# Anonymous Counselling System

## Project Overview
The Anonymous Counselling System is an Android-based application designed to provide a platform for anonymous online counselling. This system is especially relevant during challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where mental health support is crucial. The app allows users to sign up anonymously, specify the problems they need help with, and get matched with counsellors who are best suited to address their concerns.

## Features
- **Anonymous Sign-Up:** Users can sign up without revealing their identities.
- **Problem Specification:** Users can indicate the issues they need counselling for.
- **Counsellor Matching:** The system matches users with counsellors based on the problems specified and the counsellorâ€™s expertise.
- **Load Balancing:** Users are assigned to the counsellor with the fewest currently assigned users, ensuring a balanced workload.
- **Real-Time Chat:** Users can communicate with their assigned counsellor through a chat interface. Each counsellor can manage multiple chat windows for their assigned users.
